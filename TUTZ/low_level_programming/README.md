# ALX LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING
### Module of C Low-level Programming, carried out during Software Engineering studies at ```ALX SE``` and ```Holberton School```.


# Technologies
* Scripts written in **Bash 4.3.11 (1)**
* C files are compiled using :

      gcc 4.8.4 options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* C files are written according to the **C90 standard**
* C files are checked using **betty-style.pl** and **betty-doc.pl**
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04.
